1. What Z is
------------

    Z (pronounced zeta) is a multi-platform header-only base library written in
    C/C++ suitable to be used as a starting point for low-level projects. Among
    other things, it includes a modular inspection system capable of detecting
    the characteristics of the compiler and the target system at compile time.



2. What Z is not
----------------

    Z is not a substitute of the standard C library, nor of the standard C++
    library, but can be used as a base layer to implement these.
