| Format revision: v1.20 (2006-12-19)						|
|										|
| 1) Introduction								|
| ---------------								|
|										|
|    TZX is a file format designed to preserve all (hopefully) of the tapes	|
| with turbo or custom loading routines. Even though some of the newer and	|
| 'smarter' emulators can find most of the info about the loader from the code	|
| itself, this isn't possible if you want to save the file to tape, or to a	|
| real Spectrum.								|
| And with all this information in the file, the emulators don't have to bother	|
| with finding out the timings and other things.				|
|										|
|    This file format is explicitly targeted to the ZX Spectrum compatible	|
| computers only. Specialized versions of the TZX format have been defined for	|
| other machines too, e.g. the Amstrad CPC and C64, but they are now available	|
| as distinct file formats with other filename extensions.			|
|										|
|    At the end of this document you can find a description of encoding		|
| differences between these machines and a table which displays timings used by	|
| their respective ROM loading routines (some of them are not official).	|
| If you know of any other machines that have similar encoding that could be	|
| represented with this file format then let us know.				|
|										|
|    If you're looking for TZX files, you can find an extensive collection at	|
| Martijn van der Heide's 'World of Spectrum': http://www.worldofspectrum.org	|
|										|
|    The format was first started off by Tomaz Kac who was maintainer until	|
| revision 1.13, and then passed to Martijn v.d. Heide. After that, Ramsoft	|
| were the maintainers for a brief period during which the v1.20 revision was	|
| put together. If you have any questions about the format, visit the forums at	|
| World of Spectrum and ask.							|
|										|
|    The default format file extension is "TZX" and hopefully this won't have	|
| to change in the future. Amstrad CPC files should use the extension "CDT" to	|
| distinguish them from the ZX Spectrum files.					|
|										|
| 2) Rules and definitions							|
| ------------------------							|
|										|
| - Any value requiring more than one byte is stored in little endian format	|
|   (i.e. LSB first).								|
|										|
| - All unused bits should be set to zero.					|
|										|
| - The timings are given in Z80 clock ticks unless otherwise stated stated.	|
|   1 T state = (1 / 3500000) s							|
|										|
| - All ASCII texts use the ISO 8859-1 (Latin 1) encoding; some of them can	|
|   have several lines, which should be separated by ASCII code 13 decimal	|
|   (0Dh).									|
|										|
| - You might interpret 'full-period' as ----____ or ____----, and		|
|   'half-period' as ---- or ____. One 'half-period' will also be referred to	|
|   as a 'pulse'.								|
|										|
| - The values in curly brackets {} are the default values that are used in the	|
|   Spectrum ROM saving routines. These values are in decimal.			|
|										|
| - If there is no pause between two data blocks then the second one should	|
|   follow immediately; not even so much as one T state between them.		|
|										|
| - This document refers to 'high' and 'low' pulse levels. Whether this is	|
|   implemented as EAR=1 and EAR=0 respectively or the other way around is not	|
|   important, as long as it is done consistently.				|
|										|
| - Zeros and ones in 'Direct recording' blocks mean low and high pulse levels	|
|   respectively. The 'current pulse level' after playing a Direct Recording	|
|   block of CSW recording block is the last level played.			|
|										|
| - The 'current pulse level' after playing the blocks ID 10,11,12,13,14 or 19	|
|   is the opposite of the last pulse level played, so that a subsequent pulse	|
|   will produce an edge.							|
|										|
| - A 'Pause' block consists of a 'low' pulse level of some duration.		|
|   To ensure that the last edge produced is properly finished there should be	|
|   at least 1ms pause of the opposite level and only after that the pulse	|
|   should go to 'low'. At the end of a 'Pause' block the 'current pulse level'	|
|   is low (note that the first pulse will therefore not immediately produce an	|
|   edge). A 'Pause' block of zero duration is completely ignored, so the	|
|   'current pulse level' will NOT change in this case. This also applies to	|
|   'Data' blocks that have some pause duration included in them.		|
|										|
| - An emulator should put the 'current pulse level' to 'low' when starting to	|
|   play a TZX file, either from the start or from a certain position. The	|
|   writer of a TZX file should ensure that the 'current pulse level' is	|
|   well-defined in every sequence of blocks where this is important, i.e. in	|
|   any sequence that includes a 'Direct recording' block, or that depends on	|
|   edges generated by 'Pause' blocks. The recommended way of doing this is to	|
|   include a Pause after each sequence of blocks.				|
|										|
| - When creating a 'Direct recording' block please stick to the standard	|
|   sampling frequencies of 22050 or 44100 Hz. This will ensure correct		|
|   playback when using modern soundcards.					|
|										|
| - The length of a block is given in the following format: numbers in square	|
|   brackets [] mean that the value must be read from the offset in the		|
|   brackets. Other values are normal numbers.					|
|   Example: [02,03]+0A means: get number (16bit) from offset 02 and add 0A.	|
|   All numbers are in hexadecimal.						|
|										|
| - General Extension Rule: ALL custom blocks that will be added after v1.10	|
|   will have the length of the block in first 4 bytes (long word) after the ID	|
|   (this length does not include these 4 length bytes). This should enable	|
|   programs that can only handle older versions to skip that block.		|

| To be able to use a TZX file, your program must be able to handle files  |

/* MARK: - ID 16h - C64 ROM Type Data (Added in v1.13, deprecated in v1.20)
.------------------------------------------------------------------------------.
| This block was created to support the Commodore 64 standard ROM and similar  |
| tape blocks. It is made so basically anything that uses two or four pulses   |
| (which are the same in pairs) per bit can be written with it.		       |
|									       |
| Some explanation:							       |
| - A wave consists of 2 pulses. The structure contains the length of 1 pulse. |
| - The wave MUST always start with the LOW amplitude, since the C64 can only  |
|   detect the transition HIGH -> LOW.					       |
| - If some pulse length is 0 then the whole wave must not be present. This    |
|    applies to DATA too.						       |
| - The XOR checksum (if it is set to 0 or 1) is a XOR of all bits in the byte |
|   XOR-ed with the value in this field as the start value.		       |
| - Finish Byte waves should be played after each byte EXCEPT last one.	       |
| - Finish Data waves should be ONLY played after last byte of data.	       |
| - When all the Data has finished there is an optional Trailer Tone, which is |
|   standard for the Repeated Blocks in C64 ROM Loader.			       |
|									       |
| The replay procedure looks like this:					       |
| - Pilot Tone								       |
| - Sync waves								       |
| - Data Bytes (with XOR and/or Finish Byte waves)			       |
| - Finish Data pulses							       |

| of the file without disturbing the call values. Please take a look at	     |
| 'Jump To Block' for reference on the values.				     |
